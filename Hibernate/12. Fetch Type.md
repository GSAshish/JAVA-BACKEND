`fetch` type determines how associated entities or collections are loaded from the database. It specifies whether related entities or collections should be loaded eagerly or lazily.

There are two main fetch types:

1. **Eager Fetching**: When using eager fetching, associated entities or collections are loaded immediately along with the owning entity. This means that Hibernate will execute additional SQL queries to fetch the related data whenever the owning entity is fetched. Eager fetching can lead to performance issues, especially if the associated entities or collections contain a large amount of data.

   Example:
   ```java
   @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
   private Department department;
   ```

2. **Lazy Fetching**: With lazy fetching, associated entities or collections are not loaded immediately when the owning entity is fetched. Instead, they are loaded from the database only when they are accessed for the first time. Lazy fetching helps to avoid unnecessary database queries and can improve performance, especially when dealing with large object graphs.

   Example:
   ```java
   @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = "department")
   private List<Employee> employees;
   ```

By default, the fetch type is `FetchType.EAGER` for `@OneToOne` and `@ManyToOne` associations, and `FetchType.LAZY` for `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` associations. However, it's a good practice to explicitly specify the fetch type to make the fetching strategy clear and to avoid any unexpected behavior.
