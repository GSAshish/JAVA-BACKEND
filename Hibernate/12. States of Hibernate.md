Hibernate lifecycle states

### 1. Transient State
### 2. Persistent State
### 3. Removed state
### 4. Detached state



we have two things 
`database` and `session`

`session` have methods which allow to save data so this session object state we'll see



# SEE DESCRIPTION OF STATES

- when we create Entity New instance and we set it's value then it is in `Transient state`

- now when you'll do `.save` `update` or etc then it will be in `persistence State` then this will bee visible in db

-  when you'll `close` then it will get removed from session it will be `Detached State`

- when you'll `delete` then it will be in `removed database` but it will be in state

### Practical of different states

```java
public class StateDemo{
	 public static void main(String[] args){
		 // Practical of Hibernate Object States
		 // Transient 
		 // Persistent
		 // Detached
		 // Removed
		SessionFactory f=new Configuration().configure("hoibernate.cfg.xml").buildSessionFactory();
		// creating STudent object
		Student student=new Student(1444,"Peter","ABC",new Certificate("java hibernate course","2 months"));
		// student object is in transient object
		Session f=f.openSession();
		Transaction tx=s.beginTransaction();
		s.save();
		// now s is in persistance 
	    // now both db and Session is Synchronise
	    student.setName("Ravi")// this will change name later to Ravi 
	// in persistent state if you'll change anything it will also change
		tx.commit();
		// to make it detached that means keep data in db but remove from session then do this
		s.close();
		// removed state remove from db and keep in session
		
		
	 
	 }
}
