`@Embeddable` annotation is used to mark a class as embeddable. Embeddable classes are classes whose instances are stored as part of an owning entity's table rather than in a separate table. This annotation is typically used in conjunction with the `@Embedded` annotation to represent complex types that are embedded within an entity.


```java
import javax.persistence.Embeddable;

@Embeddable
public class Address {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String zipCode;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

And then, you can embed this `Address` class in another entity:
```java
import javax.persistence.Embedded;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    private String name;
    
    @Embedded
    private Address address;
    
    // Getters and setters
}

```
