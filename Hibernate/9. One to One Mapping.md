Each question have only one answer that why it is called one to one mapping


1. Unidirectional one to one
so updating Question with answer will not update Answer table in uni directional way
```java
@Entity
class Question{
	@id
	private int question_id;
	private String question;
	@OneToOne
	@JoinCoolumn(name="a_id")
	private Answer answer;
}

@Entity
class Answer{
	@id
	private int answer_id;
	private String answer;
}
```


# Bi-directional

```java
@Entity
class Question{
	@id
	private int question_id;
	private String question;
	@OneToOne
	@JoinColumn(name="a_id")
	private Answer answer;
}

@Entity
class Answer{
	@id
	private int answer_id;
	private String answer;
	@OneToOne(mappedBy="answer")
	private Question qestion;
	
}
```
