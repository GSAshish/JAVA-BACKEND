A `PreparedStatement` is a precompiled SQL statement that can be executed multiple times without the cost of recompiling the SQL statement for each execution. It also provides a defense against SQL injection attacks. Here’s an example of using a `PreparedStatement`:

whenever there is any dynamic query we use this

```java

String q="INSERT into user(name,city) VALUES(?,?)";

PreparedStatement stmt=conn.prepareStatement(q);
stmt.set(1,"ashish");
stmt.set(2."delhi");
stmt.executeUpdate();

```
