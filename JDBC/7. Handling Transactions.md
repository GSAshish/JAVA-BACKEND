JDBC allows you to handle transactions, which are a series of actions that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that either all actions are carried out, or none are, maintaining the integrity of your database. Hereâ€™s an example of handling transactions with JDBC:

```java
try {
    // Start transaction
    conn.setAutoCommit(false);

    // Execute statements
    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
    stmt.executeUpdate('INSERT INTO table VALUES (1, 'John')');
    stmt.executeUpdate('INSERT INTO table VALUES (2, 'Jane')');

    // Commit transaction
    conn.commit();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // Rollback transaction
    conn.rollback();
}

```
