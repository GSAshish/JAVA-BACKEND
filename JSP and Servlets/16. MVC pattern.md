In the context of Java web development using Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages), the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern can still be applied to create well-structured and maintainable web applications. Here's how you can implement the MVC pattern in Servlets and JSP:

1. **Model (M)**:
   - The Model represents the business logic and data of your application. It's responsible for handling data and performing operations on it. This can include database interactions, data manipulation, and business rules.
   - In a Servlet-based MVC application, your Model can be represented as Java classes or beans. These classes handle data processing and interact with the database or other data sources.
   - It should not have any direct dependency on Servlet or JSP classes.

2. **View (V)**:
   - The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. In the context of Servlets and JSP, JSP pages are commonly used as the View component.
   - JSP pages contain the HTML markup and are responsible for rendering dynamic content. They can embed Java code (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library - JSTL) to fetch data from the Model.
   - JSP pages should not contain complex business logic; they are mainly focused on displaying data.

3. **Controller (C)**:
   - The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives and processes user requests and communicates with the Model to fetch or update data.
   - Servlets are commonly used as the Controller component in a Servlet-based MVC application. Servlets receive HTTP requests, process them, and decide which Model methods to call. They then forward the data to the appropriate JSP page for rendering.
   - The Controller manages the flow of the application and decides which View to display based on the request.

Here's a high-level flow of how this pattern works in a Servlet/JSP application:

1. A user sends an HTTP request to a specific Servlet (the Controller).
2. The Servlet processes the request, interacts with the Model to fetch or update data, and decides which JSP page (the View) to forward the request to.
3. The JSP page receives the data from the Servlet and uses it to generate the HTML response, which is sent back to the user's browser.
5. The user sees the updated web page.

By following this MVC pattern, you can separate concerns in your web application, making it easier to maintain and extend. It also promotes code reusability and modularity, allowing you to change the View or the Model without affecting the other components.
