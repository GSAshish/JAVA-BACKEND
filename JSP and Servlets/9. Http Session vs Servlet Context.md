HTTP session and Servlet context are both concepts in Java web programming, specifically within the Java Servlet framework, which is used to build web applications. They serve different purposes in managing and sharing data across requests and users within a web application.

1. **HTTP Session:**
An HTTP session is a way to store and manage user-specific information across multiple requests and responses. When a user accesses a web application, a session is typically created, and a unique session ID is assigned to the user. This session ID is usually stored as a cookie in the user's browser or as a URL parameter, and it's used to associate subsequent requests from the same user with the same session.

The main features of an HTTP session are:

- **User-specific data:** You can store user-specific data in the session, such as user preferences, shopping cart contents, and authentication status.
- **Persistence:** Session data is maintained for a certain period, even if the user closes the browser or navigates away from the website. The data remains available as long as the session is active.
- **Session tracking:** Servlet containers use various methods (such as cookies or URL rewriting) to associate incoming requests with the appropriate session.

2. **Servlet Context:**
The Servlet context, also known as the application context, is a shared context that exists for the entire web application. It's accessible by all servlets and JSPs within the application. The servlet context is primarily used to store data that needs to be shared across all users and sessions of the application.

Key features of the Servlet context are:

- **Application-level data:** You can store information that should be available to all users, such as configuration settings, database connections, and application-wide variables.
- **Singleton scope:** The servlet context is a singleton, meaning there's only one instance per web application. This makes it suitable for storing data that needs to be shared across different components.
- **Shared resources:** Servlet context attributes can be used to share data between different servlets or components within the same application.

In summary, HTTP sessions are used to manage user-specific data and interactions, while the Servlet context is used to store application-wide data and resources that need to be shared across all users and sessions. They serve distinct purposes in building dynamic and interactive web applications.``
