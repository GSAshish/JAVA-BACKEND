If you want to remove the complete XML configuration for a Spring application and replace it with Java-based configuration using annotations like `@Configuration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@Bean`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Remove XML Configuration:**
   Start by removing or commenting out the XML configuration files in your Spring application. These XML files typically include `<beans>`, `<context:component-scan>`, and other XML-based configurations.

2. **Create Java Configuration Class:**
   Create a Java class that will serve as your configuration class. Annotate this class with `@Configuration` to indicate that it contains Spring bean definitions. This class will replace the XML configuration.

   ```java
   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
   public class AppConfig {
       // Define your beans using @Bean annotations
   }
   ```

   The `@ComponentScan` annotation specifies the base package(s) to scan for components (like `@Controller`, `@Service`, and `@Repository`) to be registered as Spring beans.

3. **Define Beans:**
   Within your `AppConfig` class, use the `@Bean` annotation to define Spring beans. For example:

   ```java
   @Bean
   public MyBean myBean() {
       return new MyBean();
   }
   ```

   Replace `MyBean` with the actual class of the bean you want to configure.

4. **Remove XML Bean Declarations:**
   In your XML configuration files, remove the bean declarations that you have now defined in your `AppConfig` class using `@Bean` annotations.

5. **Update Main Application Class:**
   If you have a main application class that previously loaded the XML configuration, update it to use your new Java-based configuration class. You can use the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` to load the configuration:

   ```java
   public class MainApplication {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
           // Access your beans from the context as needed
           Syso(context.myBean());
       }
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace `AppConfig.class` with the actual name of your Java configuration class.

By following these steps, you'll have removed the XML-based configuration and replaced it with Java-based configuration using annotations like `@Configuration`, `@ComponentScan`, and `@Bean`. This approach is often preferred for modern Spring applications as it provides better type safety, refactoring support, and is easier to maintain.
