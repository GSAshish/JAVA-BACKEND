spring framework have spring IOC container Basically does work of.
- object creation.
- object hold
- object injection

- we have to tell Spring Container 
	- Beans POJO classes
	- Xml we'll tell Configuration Information (which beans will be dependent on which).

- this will help IOC to inject object needed.
