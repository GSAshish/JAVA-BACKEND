- By  Initialization will initialize each Bean that is called Eager

- if will add `@Lazy` in front of any `@Component`  then whenever we are using it then only it will be initialized 


## Which is Recommended Eager is recommended so it will be also easy to find


> error in compilation time will not come in case of lazy


| Heading | Lazy Initialization | Eager initialization |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Initialization time | Bean initialized when first use of in the application | Bean initialized in startup |
| Default | Not Default | Default |
| Code Snippet | @Lazy or @Lazy(value=true) | @Lazy(value=false) and donot add |
| what happens to error | Error will result in runtime exception | Error will prevent application from starting |
| Usage | Rarely used | very frequently used |
| memory consuption | very less memory consumption | most of your Bean |
