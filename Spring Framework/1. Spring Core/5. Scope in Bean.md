@Component
class PrototypeClass{

}
```


## What is diff Between Prototype Class

for prototype class each type new instance of Bean is return this doesn't happen if scope as protype is not added.

1. `Singleton` is one IOC scope for instance
2. `Protype` new Instance each type we create it

# JAVA Singleton vs Spring Singleton

- Spring Singleton:- one object instance per spring IOC Container
- Java Single (defined By [Gang of Four](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns) ):  one object per JVM



# Singleton vs Prototype

| Heading | Prototype | Singletom |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| instances | Possible many per Spring IOC Container | Possible only one perSpring IOC Container |
| Beans | New Bean  instances created everytime refered | one only is created |
| Default | Not default | Default |
| Code Snippete | @Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) | @Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON) or Default |
| Usage | Rarely  | Default |
| Recomended Scenerio | StateFull Bean | Stateless Bean  |
