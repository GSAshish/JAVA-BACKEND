1. Singleton Scope:
   - Singleton is the default scope in Spring.
   - In Singleton scope, a single instance of a bean is created and shared across the entire application context. It remains in memory as long as the application context is active.
   - All requests for the bean return the same instance.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Component
   public class MySingletonBean {
       // ...
   }
   ```

xml
```xml
<bean id="mySingletonBean" class="com.example.MySingletonBean" />
```

2. Prototype Scope:
   - In Prototype scope, a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested from the Spring container.
   - This means that every call to get the bean results in a new object instance.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Scope("prototype")
   @Component
   public class MyPrototypeBean {
       // ...
   }
   ```

xml
```xml
<bean id="myPrototypeBean" class="com.example.MyPrototypeBean" scope="prototype" />

```

3. Request Scope:
   - Request scope is typically used in web applications. A new instance of the bean is created for every HTTP request, and it is available only during the processing of that request.
   - This scope is useful for maintaining state specific to an individual user's request.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
   @Component
   public class MyRequestScopedBean {
       // ...
   }
   ```
xml
```xml
<bean id="myRequestScopedBean" class="com.example.MyRequestScopedBean" scope="request">
    <!-- Additional configurations if needed -->
</bean>

```

4. Session Scope:
   - Session scope is also primarily used in web applications. A single bean instance is created and associated with a user's session, persisting as long as the user's session is active.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
   @Component
   public class MySessionScopedBean {
       // ...
   }
   ```

xml
```xml
<bean id="mySessionScopedBean" class="com.example.MySessionScopedBean" scope="session">
    <!-- Additional configurations if needed -->
</bean>

```

5. Global Session Scope:
   - Global Session scope is similar to Session scope but is associated with a global session, which might span multiple requests within a cluster or other distributed environments.

   Example:
   ```java
   @Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_GLOBAL_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
   @Component
   public class MyGlobalSessionScopedBean {
       // ...
   }
   ```
xml
```xml
<bean id="myGlobalSessionScopedBean" class="com.example.MyGlobalSessionScopedBean" scope="globalSession">
    <!-- Additional configurations if needed -->
</bean>

```

The choice of scope depends on the specific requirements of your application. Singleton is the most common scope, but you can use the others to control the lifecycle of beans in a web application or when you need multiple independent instances of a bean.
